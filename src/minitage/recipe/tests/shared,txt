Options shared by all the recipes
====================================

Notes
--------

    - All recipes inherit all these options, depending which you are using, those options will have an incidence on the build.
    - Useless to say that the recipes code is not difficult, and as a deployer, its your job to have a look at the code to avoid surprises.
